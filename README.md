# ðŸš§ **Maintenance Mode Alert** ðŸš§

Welcome to the `deco-sites/std` repository. Please note that this repository is currently in **maintenance** mode and is no longer actively developed. All future enhancements and features are being directed to the new repository, [deco-cx/apps](https://github.com/deco-cx/apps).

## Maintenance Mode Overview

This repository, `deco-sites/std`, is now in maintenance mode, which means that it will not receive active updates or new features. We are grateful for the contributions and support from the community that have brought this repository to where it is today. However, in our ongoing efforts to provide a more modular and flexible approach, we have transitioned to a new development model focused on the [deco-cx/apps](https://github.com/deco-cx/apps) repository.

## Transition to deco-cx/apps

All changes and enhancements that were traditionally made to `deco-sites/std` are now being directed to the [deco-cx/apps](https://github.com/deco-cx/apps) repository. It's important to note that the relationship between `deco-cx/apps` and `deco-sites/std` is unidirectional. This means that `deco-cx/apps` does not depend on `deco-sites/std`, but the reverse is true.

For the most up-to-date and active development, we strongly encourage you to check out the [deco-cx/apps](https://github.com/deco-cx/apps) repository. This new repository follows a modular and composable approach, allowing you to select and integrate apps that suit your project's needs. You can develop new apps within the `deco-cx/apps` repository and even contribute back to it by importing/exporting changes.

## We're Here to Help

While `deco-sites/std` is in maintenance mode, we're still here to support you. If you encounter any issues or have questions related to the repository, please feel free to open issues or discussions. However, for new features, enhancements, and active development, we encourage you to transition to the [deco-cx/apps](https://github.com/deco-cx/apps) repository.

Thank you for being a part of the Deco community! We're excited to continue this journey with you and look forward to seeing the amazing apps and websites you'll create using the [deco-cx/apps](https://github.com/deco-cx/apps) repository.
